This repository explores the Titanic dataset using classical machine learning techniques.

## What this project covers
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (titles, deck, family size, fare per person)
- Decision Tree and Random Forest models
- Overfitting analysis (train vs validation)
- Cross-validation to handle noisy splits
- Feature importance analysis

## Key takeaway
On a small dataset like Titanic, strong feature engineering and proper evaluation
matter more than switching to more complex models. A shallow decision tree performs
comparably to a random forest once cross-validation is applied.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
